### Boolean operators and grouping

If you want to string together multiple operators, you can use the
following:

| Operator                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AND logic                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Successive operators **with a space between them** will result in boolean "AND" logic, meaning that Tweets will match only if both conditions are met. For example, `RULE="snow day #NoSchool"` will match Tweets containing the terms snow and day and the hashtag #NoSchool. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| OR logic                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Successive operators with OR between them will result in OR logic, meaning that Tweets will match if either condition is met. For example, specifying `RULE="grumpy OR cat OR #meme"` will match any Tweets containing at least the terms grumpy or cat, or the hashtag #meme.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| NOT logic/negation                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Prepend a dash (-) to a keyword (or any operator) to negate it. For example, `RULE="cat #meme -grumpy"` will match Tweets containing the hashtag #meme and the term cat, but only if they do not contain the term grumpy. One common rule clause is -is:retweet, which will not match on Retweets, thus matching only on original Tweets, Quote Tweets, and replies. All operators can be negated, but negated operators cannot be used alone. |
| Grouping                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | You can use parentheses to group operators together. For example, `RULE="(grumpy cat) OR (#meme has:images)"` will return either Tweets containing the terms grumpy and cat, or Tweets with images containing the hashtag #meme. Note that ANDs are applied first, then ORs are applied.                                                                                                                                                       |

Note: Do not negate a set of operators grouped together in a set of
parentheses. Instead, negate every operator.
For example, instead of using `RULE="skiing -(snow OR day OR #NoSchool)"`, we suggest that you
use `RULE="skiing -snow -day -#NoSchool"`.

| keyword              | Matches a keyword within the body of a Tweet. This is a tokenized match, meaning that your keyword string will be matched against the tokenized text of the Tweet body. Tokenization splits words based on punctuation, symbols, and Unicode basic plane separator characters. For example, a Tweet with the text ‚ÄúI like coca-cola‚Äù would be split into the following tokens: I, like, coca, cola. These tokens would then be compared to the keyword string used in your rule. To match strings containing punctuation (for example coca-cola), symbol, or separator characters, you must wrap your keyword in double-quotes. | `RULE='pepsi OR cola OR "coca cola"'`                        |
| emoji                | Matches an emoji within the body of a Tweet. Similar to a keyword, emojis are a tokenized match, meaning that your emoji will be matched against the tokenized text of the Tweet body. Note that if an emoji has a variant, you must wrap it in double quotes to add to a rule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | `RULE="(üòÉ OR üò°) üò¨"`                                       |
| "exact phrase match" | Matches the exact phrase within the body of a Tweet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | `RULE='("Twitter API" OR #v2) -"filtered stream"'`           |
| #                    | Matches any Tweet containing a recognized hashtag, if the hashtag is a recognized entity in a Tweet. This operator performs an exact match, NOT a tokenized match, meaning the rule #thanku will match posts with the exact hashtag #thanku, but not those with the hashtag #thankunext.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `RULE="#thankunext #fanart OR @arianagrande"`                |
| @                    | Matches any Tweet that mentions the given username, if the username is a recognized entity (including the @ character).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | `RULE="(@twitterdev OR @twitterapi) -@twitter"`              |
| from:                | Matches any Tweet from a specific user. The value can be either the username (excluding the @ character) or the user‚Äôs numeric user ID.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | `RULE="from:twitterdev OR from:twitterapi -from:twitter"`    |
| to:                  | Matches any Tweet that is in reply to a particular user. The value can be either the username (excluding the @ character) or the user‚Äôs numeric user ID.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `RULE="to:twitterdev OR to:twitterapi -to:twitter"`          |
| url:                 | Performs a tokenized match on any validly-formatted URL of a Tweet. Works with both short URLs (https://t.co/c0A36SWil4) and real URLs (https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/labs). URL needs to be quoted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | `RULE='from:TwitterDev url:"https://developer.twitter.com"'` |
| retweets_of:         | Matches Tweets that are Retweets of the specified user.
