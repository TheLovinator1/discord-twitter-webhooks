`discord-twitter-webhooks` is an automated tool that checks [Twitter](https://twitter.com) for new tweets and sends them
to a [Discord](https://discord.com/) webhook.

This bot is configured with a config file (.env) or environment variables.

## Features

- Change Reddit username and subreddits to clickable links.
- Change Twitter username and hashtags to clickable links.
- Change t.co url to the actual url.
- If the tweet has more than one image, it will merge them into one
  image in the embed.
- Remove ®, ™ and © from the tweet text.
- Five rules can be configured, each with a different webhook.
- Customize the Discord embed.

## Installation

You have two choices, using [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/thelovinator/discord-twitter-webhooks)
or [install directly on your computer](#install-directly-on-your-computer).

### Docker

This is the recommended way to install the bot.

Docker Hub: [thelovinator/discord-twitter-webhooks](https://hub.docker.com/r/thelovinator/discord-twitter-webhooks)

    - Windows 10: Click the View Tab in File Explorer and click the box next to File name extensions.
    - Windows 11: Click View -> Show -> File name extensions.
- Open a terminal in the repository folder.
  - Windows 10: <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>right-click</kbd> in the folder and select `Open PowerShell window here`
  - Windows 11: <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>right-click</kbd> in the folder and Show more options
      and `Open PowerShell window here`
- Run the Docker Compose file:
  - `docker-compose up`
    - You can stop the bot with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>.
    - If you want to run the bot in the background, you can run `docker-compose up -d`.
- You can update the container with `docker-compose pull`
  - You can automate this with [Watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower)
      or [Diun](https://github.com/crazy-max/diun)
- To use this project on ARM64 platform such as Raspberry Pi 4, you need to modify the docker-compose.yml file with the following.  
  - Change this line from ``image: thelovinator/discord-twitter-webhooks`` to      this:  
  ```
   build:
      context: .
      platforms:
        - "linux/arm64"
  ```
  - And run normally

### Install directly on your computer

This is not recommended if you don't have an init system (e.g., systemd)

- Install the latest version of needed software:
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
    - You should use the latest version.
    - You want to add Python to your PATH.
    - Windows: Find `App execution aliases` and disable python.exe and python3.exe
  - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installation)
    - Windows: You have to add `%appdata%\Python\Scripts` to your PATH for Poetry to work.
- Download the project from GitHub with Git or download
  the [ZIP](https://github.com/TheLovinator1/discord-twitter-webhooks/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
  - If you want to update the bot, you can run `git pull` in the project folder or download the ZIP again.
- Rename .env.example to .env and open it in a text editor (e.g.,
  VSCode, Notepad++, Notepad) and fill it out.
  - Your settings will be stored in the .env file, not settings.py.
  - If you can't see the file extension:
    - Windows 10: Click the View Tab in File Explorer and click the box next to File name extensions.
    - Windows 11: Click View -> Show -> File name extensions.
- Open a terminal in the repository folder.
  - Windows 10: <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>right-click</kbd> in the folder and select `Open PowerShell window here`
  - Windows 11: <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>right-click</kbd> in the folder and Show more options
      and `Open PowerShell window here`
- Install requirements:
  - Type `poetry install` into the PowerShell window. Make sure you are
      in the repository folder where the [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) file is located.
    - (You may have to restart your terminal if it can't find the `poetry` command. Also double check it is in
          your PATH.)
- Start the bot:
  - Type `poetry run bot` into the PowerShell window.
    - You can stop the bot with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>.

Note: You will need to run `poetry install` again if [poetry.lock](poetry.lock) has been modified.

## Rules

More information about the rules can be found in
the [Twitter Documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/integrate/build-a-rule).

Operator (AND, OR, NOT) examples can be found [here](rule-operators.md).

### Get everything from a user

If you want to get tweets, replies, retweets and quotes from @Steam, @Xbox and @PlayStation.

- You can use the following rule:
  - `RULE="from:Steam OR from:Xbox OR from:PlayStation"`
  - See [#remove-retweets-replies-and-quotes](#remove-retweets-replies-and-quotes) if you only want tweets.

### Remove/Only retweets

- Remove retweets by adding -is:retweet to the rule:
  - `RULE="(from:Steam OR from:Xbox OR from:PlayStation) -is:retweet"`
    - Change -is:retweet to is:retweet to only get retweets.
    - Note that we added parentheses to group the operators together otherwise the -is:retweet would only be for
          Playstation.
- If you want to get retweets (and tweets, replies, quotes) from Steam but not Xbox or PlayStation, you can use the
  following rule:
  - `RULE="(from:Steam) OR (-is:retweet (from:Xbox OR from:PlayStation))"`

### Remove/Only replies

- Remove replies by adding -is:reply to the rule.
  - `RULE="(from:Steam OR from:Xbox OR from:PlayStation) -is:reply"`
    - Change -is:reply to is:reply to only get replies.
    - Note that we added parentheses to group the operators together otherwise the -is:reply would only be for
          Playstation.
- If you want to get replies (and tweets, retweets, quotes) from Steam but not Xbox or PlayStation, you can use the
  following rule:
  - `RULE="(from:Steam) OR (-is:reply (from:Xbox OR from:PlayStation))"`

### Remove/Only quote tweets

- Remove quote tweets by adding -is:quote to the rule:
  - `RULE="(from:Steam OR from:Xbox OR from:PlayStation) -is:quote"`
    - Change -is:quote to is:quote to only get quotes
    - Note that we added parentheses to group the operators together otherwise the -is:quote would only be for
          Playstation.
- If you want to get quote tweets (and tweets, retweets, replies) from Steam but not Xbox or PlayStation, you can use
  the following rule:
  - `RULE="(from:Steam) OR (-is:quote (from:Xbox OR from:PlayStation))"`

### Remove retweets, replies and quotes

- If you want to only get tweets from Steam, you can use the following rule:
  - `RULE="from:Steam -is:retweet -is:reply -is:quote"`
- If you have several users you have to use parentheses to group them together:
  - `RULE="(from:Steam OR from:Xbox OR from:PlayStation) -is:retweet -is:reply -is:quote"`

### Get tweets with a specific word

- If you want to get tweets with the words `pepsi`, `cola` or `coca cola`, you
  can use the following rule:
  - `RULE='pepsi OR cola OR "coca cola"'`
    - Note the double quotes around words with spaces.
    - We have to use single quotes around the rule if we used double quotes in the rule.
- If we only want to get tweets from @Xbox that are about Halo you can use the following rule:
  - `RULE="Halo from:Xbox"`
- Several words can be used in the rule:
  - `RULE='("Resident Evil" OR "Team Fortress" OR "Terraria" OR "Free Weekend") from:Steam'`
